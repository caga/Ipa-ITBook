<h1><span class="style1">Art of Java Web Development</span> Samples </h1>
<p>This readme file describes one of the samples from the book <em>Art of Java Web Development</em>: <em>Struts, Tapestry, Commons, Velocity, JUnit, Axis, Cocoon, InternetBeans, WebWork </em>by Neal Ford (Manning Publications, 2003). Information about the book is available at <a href="http://www.manning.com/ford/index.html">http://www.manning.com/ford. </a></p>
<h2>Sample application from Chapter 1: <code>art_sched_ixbeans</code></h2>
<h3>To build and run this sample:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You must install and set up the database -- see the description below. Once it is installed, you may run the ant target <code>setup-sample-database</code> to create the sample database for this sample. <em>Warning! It will removed any existing version of the database!</em> The admin user name for the database is assumed to be &quot;root&quot;, and the password is assumed to be &quot;marathon&quot;. If your values are different, modify the <strong><code>database.admin.name</code></strong> and/or <strong><code>database.admin.password</code></strong> properties in the Ant build file (defined at the top). </li>
</ol>
<h4>If you have JBuilder: </h4>
<p>A JBuilder project exists for this sample. Open <code>art.emother.servlet.jpx</code> and you can build it and run it from within JBuilder. You can also build the sample database from within JBuilder by executing the <code>setup-sample-database</code> target. </p>
<h4>If you don't have JBuilder: </h4>
<ol>
  <li>Use the Ant build tool, available from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">http://ant.apache.org</a>. Once it is installed and configured, run <code>ant</code> with no parameters to build the WAR file. </li>
  <li> To run this sample, deploy the WAR file to a servlet engine and use
    the URI <strong><code> http://&lt;server-name&gt;:&lt;port-number&gt;/sched-ixbeans/viewschedule</code></strong>.<br>
    For example, if you are using TomCat: <strong><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/sched-ixbeans/viewschedule">http://localhost:8080/sched-ixbeans/viewschedule</a>.</code></strong><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>General Information about the samples</h2>
<p>Two primary samples appear throughout the chapters. The use of only two samples
  is intentional, but the reasons are different for each instance. The samples
  are designed to illustrate the topics in the chapters, including the architecture,
design, and specific techniques.</p>
<h3>The eMotherEarth.com sample</h3>
  <p>The architecture and technique samples revolve around the fictitious eMotherEarth e-commerce site. This site sells earth products, like dirt, leaves, mountains....
  Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about delivering the products; we&rsquo;re just presenting
  a catalog. The application is a simple four-page web application that allows
  logon, catalog display, checkout, and confirmation. Even though it&rsquo;s small, this site
  is sufficient for us to highlight navigation, techniques, and architecture.
  We use the eMotherEarth application in the early chapters to illustrate the
  architecture of web applications and how it has evolved from servlets, to JSP and
  custom tags, to the currently accepted industry standards. In later chapters, we use
  the same sample application to illustrate various techniques for creating user interfaces,
implementing caching, managing resources, and other advanced topics.
  </p>
</p>
  <h3>The schedule sample</h3>
  <p>    The other primary sample in Art of Java Web Development is the schedule application.
    It is a simple two-page application that manages scheduling information,
    and it appears in all the framework chapters. One of the goals of our book is to
    show the various web frameworks in a manner that permits direct, head-to-head
    comparison of features. Evaluating the frameworks based on their samples and
    documentation doesn&rsquo;t allow you to perform this &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison
    because there is no ANSI standard web application sample.<br>
    The framework chapters all build the same schedule application, each using
    the framework discussed in that chapter. Unless otherwise noted, all the samples
    use the same infrastructure for database access and representation of entities. The
    difference in each case is the framework itself. It is remarkable how different the
    versions of this sample end up, given the similarities of the basic architecture of
    most of the frameworks and the common elements used to build them. However,
    as you will see, the framework makes a tremendous difference in the implementation
    of a web application.</p>
  <h3>Sample setup</h3>
  <p>    Art of Java Web Development is an intermediate to advanced book on web frameworks
    and best practices. As such, we do not cover the basics of setting up a development
    environment for the samples. You must handle that yourself. However, it
    is exhaustively covered in other books and on the Internet. Two infrastructure
    pieces are needed for the samples: a database server and a servlet engine. Each
    sample does include an Ant file to build the sample using the Ant build utility. Ant
    is available at ant.apache.org and is covered extensively in Manning&rsquo;s book Java
  Development with Ant, by Erik Hatcher and Steve Loughran.</p>
  <h4>    The database</h4>
  <p>    Virtually all the samples in this book connect to a database because most realworld
    applications also have to retrieve data from a database. We use the MySQL
    database (available at www.mysql.com) because it is open source (and therefore
    free for developer use) and because it is a great database server. However, you
    aren&rsquo;t forced to use it to run the samples. With each of the samples, we include a
    generic SQL setup script that builds the database for the application. The setup
    script is designed around MySQL but can be easily modified to work in any ANSI
    standard database server. To run the samples with MySQL, you must download it
    and set it up yourself. You can download it <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">here</a>. </p>
  <h4>The servlet engine    </h4>
  <p>The web applications in this book utilize standard Java web development code, so
        they all run in any Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE)-compliant servlet engine.
        Unless otherwise noted, we generally use Tomcat for the samples because it is
        open source and is the reference implementation of the servlet API. Because the
        samples are J2EE compliant, they will run in any servlet engine.
        The exceptions to the previous rule of thumb are applications that illustrate
        particular J2EE features not found in Tomcat. For example, chapter 12 features
        Enterprise JavaBeans and uses the JBoss application server instead of Tomcat. In<br>
    any case, the samples all run in any servlet engine or application server that
  matches the standard J2EE architecture. </p>
