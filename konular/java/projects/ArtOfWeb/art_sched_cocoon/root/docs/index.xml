    <MainDescription>
      <Greeting>Seamlessly create, configure, test, and deploy Cocoon web applications from within the IDE!</Greeting>
      <Para>Cocoon is tightly integrated with JBuilder allowing you to publish
      your XML documents using Cocoon's servlet-based, Java publishing framework.
      Because Cocoon is based on XSL stylesheets and XSLT transformation, it allows
      complete separation of content and style, as well as allowing different
      presentations of the same data. </Para>

          Start by using the Cocoon Web Application wizard to quickly create your XML web application.
        </FeatureListItems>
        <FeatureListItems>
          Then, create, validate, and transform your individual XML and XSL pages using JBuilder's XML features.
        </FeatureListItems>
        <FeatureListItems>
          When you are ready with your application, use the JBuilder XML editor to configure your Cocoon environment.
        </FeatureListItems>
        <FeatureListItems>
          Launch the Cocoon framework through Web Run and test your application.

        <FeatureListItems>
          Finally, do a Make Project and deploy the generated cocoon.war.
                This is done automatically when you invoke Web Run.
